# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.2.2

### Changed

- Reworked the UK Environment Agency visual editor into a loaded station dropdown with a live filter.
- UK station filtering now matches station name, river, town, and station code.

### Fixed

- Fixed the UK station search button reading stale text when a user typed a search and clicked immediately.

## 0.2.1

### Added

- Added repository packaging for HACS/custom repository use, including changelog, issue templates, examples, license, beta tester checklist, project insights, and frontend syntax check workflow.

### Changed

- Expanded README documentation for installation, configuration, data providers, troubleshooting, safety, privacy, and contribution guidance.
- Removed the single-country HACS metadata value because RiverWise now supports both US and UK providers.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- Added UK Environment Agency provider support.
- Added UK station search and manual station lookup in the visual editor.
- Added observed UK water-level hydrographs.
- Added UK-specific summary text and data attribution notes.

### Changed

- Preserved existing US NOAA/NWS NWPS support while adding the UK provider path.

### Notes

- US NOAA/NWS NWPS gauges support observed and forecast stage where the NWPS API provides them.
- UK Environment Agency stations currently render observed readings only. The EA real-time flood-monitoring API does not expose the same forecast crest feed as NWPS.
